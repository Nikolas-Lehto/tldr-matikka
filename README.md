## To do

### In the near future

* **Write (more) courses**
* Rewrite the template handling logic as it's spaghetti right now and tidy up the repo overall
* Come up with more stuff to put on the landing page (and mayhaps make some "about us/how to contribute" page)

### When that's all done

1. Update the frontend and branding. I don't like them
   * Some stylistic upgrades. Perhaps a main color? A logo?
   * Add a search feature and individual topic views
2. Get every MAA and MAY course written down
4. Think about writing materials for MAB
5. Look into ways to pitch the project to the Finnish education system(?)
